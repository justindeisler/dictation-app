# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Native macOS menu bar dictation app that captures speech via a global hotkey and pastes transcribed text into any active text field. Uses Groq's Whisper API for fast, accurate transcription. Built for coding workflows — specifically for dictating descriptions and requests while working with Claude Code.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Settings

**Goal:** User can configure the app with API credentials
**Depends on:** None (foundation phase)
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create Xcode project with menu bar presence (no dock icon)
- [x] 01-02: Implement settings window with API key storage and validation
- [x] 01-03: Implement launch at login with SMAppService

**Details:**
- App appears only in menu bar (LSUIElement=true)
- Settings window accessible from menu bar menu
- Groq API key stored in Keychain via KeychainAccess library
- Launch at login via SMAppService with System Settings guidance

---

### Phase 2: Core Recording & Permissions

**Goal:** User can record audio via global hotkey with visual feedback
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Create PermissionManager and AudioRecorder foundation services
- [x] 02-02: Implement hotkey detection and visual recording feedback

**Details:**
- Option+Space global hotkey via KeyboardShortcuts library
- Visual recording feedback with red waveform icon
- Microphone and Accessibility permission flows
- 16kHz mono WAV audio format for Groq API

---

### Phase 3: Transcription & API

**Goal:** User's recorded audio is transcribed accurately in English and German
**Depends on:** Phase 1 (API key), Phase 2 (audio recording)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Implement Groq Whisper API transcription and language settings
- [x] 03-02: Integrate transcription workflow with recording completion

**Details:**
- whisper-large-v3-turbo model for transcription
- 60-second timeout for audio processing
- Language preference in Settings (auto-detect, English, German)
- NotificationCenter-based result broadcasting

---

### Phase 4: Output & Paste

**Goal:** Transcribed text appears automatically in active text field
**Depends on:** Phase 2 (accessibility), Phase 3 (transcription)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: PasteManager service for clipboard and paste operations
- [x] 04-02: AppDelegate integration with transcription notifications

**Details:**
- CGEvent keyboard simulation for Cmd+V paste
- Clipboard fallback when paste fails
- Works across all standard macOS apps
- Accessibility permission guidance when denied

---

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Polish

**Goal:** User receives clear feedback when things go wrong
**Depends on:** All previous phases
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Error notification system with throttling (ERR-01, ERR-02)
- [x] 05-02: Missing API key handling with blocking alert (ERR-03)
- [x] 05-03: Menu bar visual states and network error handling (ERR-04)

**Details:**
- UNUserNotificationCenter for error notifications
- 5-second throttle to prevent notification spam
- API key check before recording (faster feedback)
- Menu bar state machine: idle → recording → processing → error
- Network error categorization (timeout vs. connection lost)

---

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None (linear execution)

**Key Decisions:**

- 5-phase roadmap (quick depth) — Compressed research's 7 phases to critical path
- Non-sandboxed distribution — Required for CGEvent.post() paste functionality
- NSStatusItem over MenuBarExtra — Better macOS 14.0 compatibility and icon control
- KeyboardShortcuts library — Reliable global hotkey registration
- 60-second transcription timeout — Audio processing takes time
- 150ms paste delay — Safe timing for clipboard-to-paste workflow

**Issues Resolved:**

- Menu bar icon color fixed (NSImage.SymbolConfiguration vs. contentTintColor)
- Swift 6 concurrency compliance for singleton managers
- Settings Save button enabling for language preference changes
- Accessibility permission guidance for paste failures

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None identified during audit
